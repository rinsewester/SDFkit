CSDFgraph class
===============

In SDFkit, all functionality is built on top of the class CSDFGraph.
All graphs are instantiations of this class and supports the construction and simulation of CSDF graphs.

CSDFGraph is based on the `NetworkX <https://networkx.github.io/>`_ directed
graph class. Therefore, a lot of graph functions can also be applied to CSDF
graphs. The following documentation is enerated from the python source code:


.. automodule:: csdfgraph
.. autoclass:: CSDFGraph
