Welcome to the SDFkit documentation!

SDFkit is dataflow graph simulator and code generator.
Using SDFkit, dataflow graphs can be simulated in an interactive environment.
Additionally, FPGA code can be generated to run graph in hardware.
Let's have a look:



To get started with SDFkit, information regarding installation and using the program can be found in :ref:`sect-using-sdfkit`.

The JSON based file format for graphs is described in :ref:`sect-graph-file-format`.

The class on which all modeling and simulation is based, the CSDFGraph class, is documented in :ref:`sect-csdfgraph-class`.
